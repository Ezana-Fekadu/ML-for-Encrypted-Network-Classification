# ML-for-Encrypted-Network-Classification

### Project Description
---

 Machine Learning for Encrypted Traffic Classification (Research-Level)
 Classify encrypted network traffic using ML techniques without decrypting it.


Collect or simulate encrypted network traffic.

Extract traffic features (packet size, timing, etc.).

Train ML models to classify applications or detect anomalies.

Evaluate model accuracy and privacy preservation.
Skills: Cryptography, machine learning, network security.
Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, PyCryptodome.
Publishable Aspect: Novel ML-based method for analyzing encrypted traffic while preserving privacy.
